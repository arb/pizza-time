This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running

```sh
npm install
```

followed by

```sh
npm start
```

Then you should be about to point a modern browser to `http://localhost:3000/` and start shopping!

Styling is pretty non-existent but I did use flex box for the main page layout to do 2 columns.

I wrote some tests but obviously not nearly as many as a real app would have. To run the tests run

```sh
npm test
```
